# Machine Perception Cheatsheet

Cheatsheet for the Machine Perception course at ETH ZÃ¼rich (SS2025).

This cheatsheet covers the full course content from foundational deep learning (gradient descent, CNNs, RNNs) to advanced generative models (VAEs, GANs, diffusion models, normalizing flows) and modern 3D perception techniques (NeRF, 3D Gaussian Splatting, parametric human models like SMPL).
